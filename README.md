### Running this project:

#### Should be incredibly simple: Just make sure you have kivy installed (can run pip install kivy if necessary).
#### Might be helpful to create a virtual environment for this 
        - python3 -m venv {VENV_NAME}
        - {VENV_NAME}/Scripts/activate (Windows) / source {VENV_NAME}/bin/activate (Mac / Linux)

### Then just run python3 main.py
